# Transaction Analysis Dashboard Documentation

## Overview
- A robust React-based dashboard for analyzing transaction rules, identifying patterns, and enabling real-time financial monitoring.
- Designed to handle large datasets efficiently with a focus on performance, usability, and responsive design.

## Approach
- Developed a modular, scalable, and user-centric application using modern web technologies.
- Emphasized performance optimizations, intuitive navigation, and responsive layouts for seamless user experience across devices.

## Technologies
- **React with Vite**: Enables fast development and optimized production builds for dynamic UI rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides utility-first styling for responsive, consistent, and maintainable design.
- **Lucide React**: Supplies consistent and scalable icons for enhanced visual appeal.
- **React Hooks**: Manages state efficiently for real-time updates and data handling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Powers application logic with modern, clean syntax.
- **CDN (jsDelivr)**: Hosts dependencies like React and ReactDOM for reliable delivery.

## Design Decisions
- **Modular Architecture**: Built reusable React components for scalability and maintainability.
- **Responsive Design**: Used Tailwind CSS to ensure compatibility across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented pagination and data caching to handle large datasets (e.g., 2,880 transactions).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Incorporated intuitive filters, search, and visual feedback for ease of use.
- **Consistent Styling**: Leveraged Tailwind CSS for a cohesive, professional look with minimal custom CSS.

## Key Features
- **Navigation Bar**: Offers quick access to Rule Debugging Console, Financial Analytics, and Real-Time Monitoring.
- **Advanced Filtering**:
  - Multi-criteria filters: Active Rules (dropdown), Date Range (mm/dd/yyyy), Price Range (min/max), Priority (High/Medium/Low), Currency (PAB, GTQ, CRC, BRL, USD, MXN, COP).
  - Real-time search by receiver, city, country, or merchant.
  - Visual triggers for rule-based filtering and multi-select currency support.
- **Data Table**:
  - Displays paginated transactions (default: 20 entries per page) with columns: Sender, Receiver, Amount, Timestamp, Risk, Rules, Actions (Analyze button).
  - Features sortable columns, sticky headers, and color-coded risk indicators (High, Medium, Low).
- **Pagination**:
  - Configurable page sizes (20, 30, 50, 75, 100 entries).
  - Sticky controls (First, Previous, Next, Last, page numbers with ellipsis) for efficient navigation.
- **Transaction Analysis**:
  - Detailed view includes Transaction ID, Amount, Timestamp, Type, Parties (Sender, Receiver), Location, Risk Level, and Applied Rules with conditions and trigger status (e.g., High Value Transaction Alert: amount > 1,000 CRC).
  - Responsive layout: table for desktop, card-based for mobile.
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded risk indicators, interactive rule badges, and clear filter state visualization.

## Implementation Details
- **Data Management**: Utilizes React hooks for efficient state management, optimized filtering logic, and smart data caching for real-time updates.
- **Responsive Interface**:
  - Desktop: Full-featured table with sortable columns and sticky headers.
  - Mobile: Card-based layout with touch-optimized controls and responsive filter panels.
- **Performance**: Pagination and caching ensure memory-efficient handling of large datasets with fast response times.
